## The Problem

#### Spectacle making was once a hallmark of British craft, closely tied to the watching making trades around Hatton Garden, London. 

#### The world's first pair of spectacles was made in Soho by Edward Scarlett in 1730, and British Standards becme the highest in the world. Spectacles were made specifically for an individual, to both fit impeccably and provide excellent visual acuity

#### Today, however, spectacles have become a commoditised, ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution to what is a very individual problem.
